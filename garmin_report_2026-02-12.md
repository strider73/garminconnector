## Coach's Analysis: Yehwan's Week (Feb 6-12)

### Overall Assessment
Yehwan had an **inconsistent week** with two high-output days (Fri, Wed) separated by very low activity days. For a UTR 8 player targeting UTR 12+, the training pattern needs more structure and consistency.

### Sleep: The Biggest Limiter
- **Average 6.5 hrs/night is not enough.** Elite tennis players (UTR 12+) typically need 8-9 hours. Sleep is when muscle repair, motor skill consolidation, and reaction time recovery happen.
- **Bedtimes are too late** (12:40 AM - 2:00 AM). Late nights reduce deep sleep quality even when total hours look okay. A 20-year-old athlete should aim for 10:30-11:00 PM bedtime.
- **Missing sleep data on Sun and Wed** suggests the watch wasn't worn or sleep was too fragmented to track - either way, that's a red flag.
- **Bright spot:** Deep sleep avg 70 min/night and REM avg 58 min/night are solid when he does sleep. His body wants to recover - he just needs to give it enough time.

### Recovery: Strong Foundation
- **Resting HR 49-55 bpm** is excellent for a 20-year-old athlete. This shows good cardiovascular fitness.
- **HRV 61-71 ms (avg 68)** indicates strong autonomic recovery. His nervous system is handling the training load well.
- These numbers suggest his body CAN handle harder training - but only if sleep improves. High HRV with low sleep is a ticking time bomb for injury.

### Training Load: Boom-or-Bust Pattern
- **Friday:** 18,260 steps, 17.3 km, 163 max HR, 54 mins intensity - this was a massive day. Likely a match or intense practice.
- **Saturday:** Moderate day with 47 mins moderate intensity (probably a practice session).
- **Sunday:** Essentially a rest day (17 steps). Complete rest is fine after Friday's load, but no active recovery is a missed opportunity.
- **Monday-Tuesday:** Low activity. Only 20 combined intensity minutes.
- **Wednesday:** Another big day - 10.8 km, 162 max HR, 61 mins intensity. Another match or hard session.
- **Thursday:** Near-zero activity (956 steps). Recovery day or inactivity?

**The problem:** Two hard days and five easy/rest days is not how you build to UTR 12. Elite players train 5-6 days/week with periodized intensity.

### What UTR 12 Demands vs. Where Yehwan Is

| Metric | Yehwan This Week | UTR 12 Target |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Training days/week | 2-3 active | 5-6 active |
| Weekly intensity mins | 201 (142 mod + 59 vig) | 400-500+ |
| Vigorous mins/week | 59 | 150-200 |
| Avg sleep | 6.5 hrs | 8-9 hrs |
| Bedtime | 12:40 AM - 2:00 AM | 10:30-11:00 PM |
| Daily steps (training days) | 7,269 avg | 12,000-15,000 |

### Priority Recommendations (Next 4 Weeks)

**1. Fix Sleep First (Week 1-2)**
- Set a hard bedtime of 11:00 PM. No screens after 10:30 PM.
- This alone will improve reaction time, shot selection, and recovery between points.
- Target: 7.5 hrs minimum, working toward 8+ hrs.

**2. Add Training Consistency (Week 2-3)**
- Move from 2-3 active days to 4-5 active days.
- Add 2 moderate sessions (footwork drills, rally practice, light fitness) on current rest days.
- Keep 2 high-intensity days (match play, sprint drills) and 1 active recovery day.

**3. Increase Vigorous Intensity (Week 3-4)**
- Current 59 vigorous mins/week needs to at least double.
- Add interval training: 30-sec sprints with 60-sec rest, 10 reps, 2x/week.
- On-court: Practice point patterns at match intensity, not just rallying.

**4. Suggested Weekly Structure**
```
Mon: On-court technical work + fitness (moderate)
Tue: Match-intensity practice or competitive sets (vigorous)
Wed: Active recovery - light hitting, stretching, mobility
Thu: On-court drills + sprint/agility work (vigorous)
Fri: Match play or high-intensity practice (vigorous)
Sat: Supplementary fitness - gym, footwork, endurance (moderate)
Sun: Full rest
```

### Bottom Line
Yehwan has an excellent athletic base (low resting HR, strong HRV, good deep sleep when he actually sleeps). The gap between UTR 8 and UTR 12 is not fitness - it's **consistency and sleep discipline**. Fix the bedtime, train 5 days instead of 2-3, and the physical metrics will follow. The body is ready; the habits need to catch up.
