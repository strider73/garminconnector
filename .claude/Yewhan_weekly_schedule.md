## TRAINING GUIDANCE NOTES

### Intensity Management
- Natural taper: Mon-Wed hard → Thu-Fri easing off → Sat competition
- Tuesday is the biggest load day — monitor this day's Garmin data closely
- Friday squad session is fun/social but watch HR — competitive players can go hard unconsciously

### Sunday Tempo Run Protocol
- **Purpose:** Fill aerobic high zone shortage (Garmin feedback: AEROBIC_HIGH_SHORTAGE)
- **Post-match version:** 20 min, 3.5–4.0 km
- **No-match version:** 25–30 min, 4.5–5.5 km
- **Pace:** 5:20–5:40/km
- **HR ceiling:** 165 bpm — slow down if exceeded
- **Progression:** Start at 20 min for weeks 1–2, build to 25 min weeks 3–4, then 30 min weeks 5+

### Sleep Targets
- Every night: minimum 7.5 hours
- Friday night (pre-match): 8 hours, in bed by 11:00 PM
- Sleep is the single biggest free performance gain available

### Garmin Interpretation Context
- ACWR may appear elevated due to low chronic load from injury period — this will normalize over 3–4 weeks
- Trust HRV/RHR trends over ACWR when returning from injury
- Wear watch every night for consistent data

### Red Flags — When to Ease Off
- HRV below 55 for 3+ consecutive days
- RHR above 55 for 3+ consecutive days
- If triggered: drop Wednesday to moderate intensity, skip Sunday PM court session

### Progression Plan
- **Weeks 1–2:** Establish Sunday jog habit at 20 min. Let chronic load build naturally.
- **Weeks 3–4:** Extend Sunday jog to 25–30 min. ACWR should normalize toward 1.0–1.2.
- **Weeks 5–6:** Garmin should show PRODUCTIVE. Aerobic high numbers climbing. Reassess.
